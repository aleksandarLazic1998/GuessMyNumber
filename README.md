# GuessMyNumber

This simple game was made with Vanilla JavaScript and in the game you have to guess the number between 1 and 20. 
With every wrong guess you will have your score decrease by 1 and the game will tell you the righ number is lower or higher than you entered.
If the score reaches 0 the game is over and you need to restart the game on the "Again!" button.
